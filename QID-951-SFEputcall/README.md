Example : 'For given parameters [Strike Price, Spot Price, Interest Rate] like [800, 750, 0.1], and
[Remaining Time, Price of European Put, Value of all Earnings and Costs Related to Underlying] like
[0.8, 5.4, 2] the price of the European call option is calculated.'

P   = 5.4     # Price of European Put
D   = 2       # Value of all Earnings and Costs Related to Underlying
