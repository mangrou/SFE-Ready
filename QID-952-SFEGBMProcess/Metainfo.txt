Name of QuantLet: SFEGBMProcess

Published in: Statistics of Financial Markets

Description: 'Simulation of discrete observations of a Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) via direct integration (method=1) or Euler scheme (method=2). The process follows the stochastic differential equation: dX(t) = mu X(t) dt + sigma X(t) dW(t).'

Keywords: Euler, brownian-motion, direct integration, discrete, geometric-brownian-motion, graphical representation, normal-distribution, plot, process, random-number-generation, simulation, stochastic, stochastic-process, wiener-process
