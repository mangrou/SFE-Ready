Name of QuantLet: SFEPortfolioLossDensity

Published in: Statistics of Financial Markets

Description: 'Computes the density function of the loss in a portfolio of bonds or other credit instruments using a one-factor Gaussian copula. The marginal densities of default times are implemented as poisson distributions using constant default intensities. After computing the portfolio loss densities for various values of the dependence parameter rho, these densities are plotted.'
